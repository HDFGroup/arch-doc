It is not easy to mentally map HDF5 API calls to actual IO activity. This is the case for three reasons:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The HDF5 library is an intermediate abstraction layer
    \item The goal of serializing collections of objects into files
    \item IO activity occurs in blocks.
\end{enumerate}
