These guided tours introduce certain architectural elements in a specific context, and the level of detail is calibrated to the context. Complete coverage of the architectural concepts is provided in Chapter~\ref{part:reference}.

A simple program typically sets the course of a specific guided tour, and the call stack is the starting point for ``HDF5 library stratigraphy.'' We will examine how changes in the program change the call stack and activate and exercise different parts of the library. We hope the samples extracted from several well-placed ``stratigraphic test wells'' will create a reasonably accurate and complete picture of the library's modular structure and functional allocation.
