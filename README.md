## Project Philosophy

> I don't mean a bricks and mortar architect. I mean an architect as used in the words _architect of foreign policy_. I mean architect as in the creating of systemic, structural, and orderly principles to make something work -- the thoughtful making of either artifact, or idea, or policy that informs because it is clear. I use the word information in its truest sense. Most of the word information contains the word _inform_, so I call things information only if they inform me, not if they are just collections of data, of stuff. (Saul Wurman)
